\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}

My name is Alfonso Trigo and I am a computer engineer with more than 5 years of experience in specification, development and testing of automotive software.\\\\
During the last years, I have been responsible for updating and maintaining technical specifications of several connected services for a leading OEM, as well as managing three teams working on the development and verification of automotive software.\\\\
Recently, my couple got an interesting job offer to work as a teacher in Lisbon and we both decided to move to Portugal. In my case, I keep working remotely for my company due to the pandemic circumstances, but started to consider a change given the available opportunities in the city.

In this context, I found very interesting the offer posted by Siemens on Linkedin portal and thought that my profile could be close to what you are looking for.\\
If you also consider that I might fit in, I would be very glad to participate in the process.

Thank you very much for your time and please, do not hesitate to let me know if any additional information about my background or circumstances is needed.\\

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
